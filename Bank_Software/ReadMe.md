this is a bank software I have worked on. I am only halfway through with this exercise and not completely finished. this exercise is about csv and db

***We need two different classes for users - a client, and a banker. A client should be able to view all their accounts, deposit and withdraw funds to and from their OWN accounts, and transfer money from their OWN accounts to another user account. A banker should be able to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds from ANY user account, and transfer money between ANY two user accounts. A banker should not have any accounts (no co-mingling of funds) and a person should not see the superuser options that bankers have. How you want to design this is up to you.***

this exercise was done using the MVC pattern!
