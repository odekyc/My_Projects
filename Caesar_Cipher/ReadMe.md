[Caesar's Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is named after Julius Caesar, who used it with a shift of three to protect messages of military significance.

A shift of three to the right would change the letters thusly:

	A => D
	B => E
	C => F
	Z => C

A shift of three to the left would change the letters... 

	A => X 
	B => Y 
	C => Z
	D => A

in this exercise, we write two methods, 
first method ask user for a message and number of shifts and convert it into Caesar Cipher
second method decipher the Caesar Cipher back into the original message
