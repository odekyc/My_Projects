in this exercise, the screen will prompt the user to enter a float number, and I will write a method that gives the number of American coins and bills needed to represent that number.

for example, if the float is '12.33', the method will return 1 $10 bill, 2 $1 bills, 1 quarter, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies.
